Themese of OOP patters
Factory - create a type of object depending on certain conditions
Singleton - create one and only one instance of the function, unique one
Flyweight - create a complex object "with lean resource/memory consumption"

Adaptor - adapts a new function (to exchange the old one) to an old code workflow by providing the same input-output interface
Bridge - passes one object methods to another object methods and provides unity interfaces
Decorator - adds to the object/ function other "resposibilities", props or modify them, returning next object
Proxy - utilizes object/props structure to reduce using other recourses caching the unique values

Interpreter - to transform object state passing it "through another object"
Mediator - to apply to the object method of the mediator and leave a footprint of that in the mediator state
Iterator - to approach to reach all array/object members/props with stated method
Composite - to create objects in a tree structure of the "root object"
Memento - to restore object state
Observer - to perform (fire) actions (run function for example) on an objects (after and once they are subscribed); to unsubscribe it from that action if necessary
State - to store, change and return an object, that reflects state of the app. Optionally, to keep state history
